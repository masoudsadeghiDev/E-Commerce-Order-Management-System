Project Idea: E-Commerce Order Management System
A Java-based Order Management System that follows Hexagonal Architecture and uses Hibernate for data persistence. This project will handle product management, customer orders, payments, and inventory tracking.

Project Structure (Hexagonal Architecture)
Hexagonal Architecture separates business logic from infrastructure, making it easy to scale and test.
