# **E-Commerce Order Management System**  

## **Project Overview**  
The **E-Commerce Order Management System** is a **Java-based** application designed to manage product inventory, customer orders, and payments efficiently. Built using **Hexagonal Architecture**, it ensures a clean separation between business logic and infrastructure, making the system **scalable, maintainable, and testable**.  

## **Project Structure (Hexagonal Architecture)**  
The project follows **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** to separate core business logic from external dependencies like databases, APIs, and messaging systems.  

```
ecommerce-order-system/
â”‚â”€â”€ application/       # Business logic (use cases)
â”‚â”€â”€ domain/            # Entities, Aggregates, and Value Objects
â”‚â”€â”€ infrastructure/    # Hibernate, Database, Adapters (REST, Messaging)
â”‚â”€â”€ configuration/     # Spring Boot Configurations
â”‚â”€â”€ main/              # Main Application
```

## **Tech Stack**  
The system is built using modern Java technologies for reliability and scalability.  

- **Java (Spring Boot)** â€“ For building RESTful APIs.  
- **Hibernate (JPA)** â€“ For Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).  
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ As the primary relational database.  
- **Lombok** â€“ To reduce boilerplate code.  
- **Docker** â€“ For containerization and easy deployment.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **User Management** â€“ Register, login, and manage roles (Admin, Customer, Seller).  
âœ… **Product Management** â€“ Add, update, and delete products.  
âœ… **Inventory Tracking** â€“ Monitor stock levels in real time.  
âœ… **Order Management** â€“ Create, update, and cancel orders with multiple statuses.  
âœ… **Payment Integration** â€“ Support for payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Follows **Hexagonal Architecture** for modular expansion.
